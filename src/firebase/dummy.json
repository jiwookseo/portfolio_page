      "content": "The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.\n\nEach of our web design teams (Raleigh Web Design Team and our Wake Forest Web Design Team) utilize portions of the Agile and Scrum methodology within our projects. Below you will find an overview of the agile process (and what has been called “agile project management for dummies”) as well as a simple definition of the agile methodology for any beginners starting out in software design and development, or those who may want to integrate the methodology into their seo agency or web design company.",

      "content": "Much of sprint planning involves a negotiation between the product owner and the team to determine the focus and work to tackle in the upcoming sprint. It's useful to time-box the planning meeting, restricting it to 4 hours or less.\n\nIn the first part of the meeting, your product owner meets with your team to discuss the user stories that might be included in the sprint. Your product owner will share information and answer any questions that your team has about those stories. This conversation might reveal details such as data sources, user interface layout, response time expectations, and considerations for security and usability. Your team should capture these details within the backlog items form. During this part of the meeting, your team learns what it must build.\n\nAs you plan your sprints, you may discover additional requirements that you should capture and add to your backlog. Before your sprint planning meeting, you'll want to refine your backlog to make sure that it is well defined and in priority order.\n\nAlso, setting a sprint goal as part of your planning efforts can help the team stay focused on what's most important for each sprint.\n\nAfter you've planned your sprint, you may want to share the plan with key stakeholders.",

      "title": "3 ways to ease external collaboration tension with Jira",
      "content": "Information is power. When everyone’s priorities are clear, we can make better decisions for our project and the organization as a whole. Once upon a time at an old job, I needed a considerable amount of the IT group’s time to help me get a new CRM server up and running for my project. I often got the answer: “Wait.” but I never knew why. Deadlines were looming, and it was becoming hard to explain to my stakeholders why things were delayed. I didn’t know what priorities were trumping me, or if I could work with those parties in a more symbiotic fashion. What I did know was that there had to be a better answer than “wait.”\n\nAt least once in everyone’s career, we’ll struggle to work well with other teams. We lovingly refer to this as external collaboration tension. When your team relies on help from an external team, challenges arise, because each team has unique motivations and a myriad of tasks to accomplish. One of the main difficulties in working with an external team is a lack of visibility into what they have on their plate. When we don’t have context, we tend to assume that our requests are the most important in the other team’s workload. As a result, you not only place undue pressure on the other team but also makes things harder for you. Since we’ve all been there before, in this article we’ll take a look at some ways to make working with external teams easier and more efficient.",

      "content": "The most common stat that people talk about is the percentage of their visits that comes from mobile devices. Here is a look at the percentage of visits sites get from mobile vs. desktop for 2016, 2017, and 2018.\n\nThe data continues to show that for most sites, the majority of their traffic comes from mobile devices. This is a critical fact of life for all business and media websites.\n\nIt’s also interesting to consider total time on site. Here is what we see across the three years.\n\nBear in mind, that’s the percentage of total aggregated time across all visits for mobile, compared with that of desktop. The total time users spend on sites when using desktop devices is still larger than the total time for mobile. This suggests that the time per visit must be longer, as we see here.\n\nWith the new data sources from SimilarWeb, the mobile bounce rate is back up a bit, but still lower than it was in 2016. As found in last year’s study, we believe that mobile site experiences are improving, and users are getting more comfortable with it. However, desktop still has the lead over mobile as it relates to bounce rate, and that’s not likely to change. For one thing, the use cases for people on mobile devices often involve the need to look something up quickly while they are on the go.",

Machine-learning programs, in a sense, adjust themselves in response to the data they’re exposed to (like a child that is born knowing nothing adjusts its understanding of the world in response to experience).\n\nSamuel taught a computer program to play checkers. His goal was to teach it to play checkers better than himself, which is obviously not something he could program explicitly. He succeeded, and in 1962 his program beat the checkers champion of the state of Connecticut.",

After about 2 years of using Vue almost daily I can finally write about it with some perspective.\n\nData binding is a big deal in the front end world. Instead of micromanaging the DOM like we did with jQuery we now focus on data. Vue handles this neatly with a two-way reactive data-binding system.\n\nTo achieve this reactivity Vue adds a number of getters and setters to every variable in your state so that it can track changes and update the DOM automatically (cough this.setState() cough). This approach is not perfect, as we’ll see later.",

      "content": "Our small dev team is about to ship one of its most impressive client projects to date. I'm at my stand-up desk, skimming through morning emails. My partner bursts through the office door:\n\n\"Something's wrong with our Angular app, man. I've got a digest is already in progress error popping everywhere—can't figure out what's happening,\" he says, visibly nervous.\n\nBut I'm not nervous, nor stressed. I know exactly where to start looking, because I know my JavaScript.\n\nAnd I know all of this thanks to a robot.\n\nRewind to 2011.\n\nI was still a dreamy-eyed software engineer student back then, unaffected by the business imperatives of real-world coding. I was passionate about back-end development and had no desire whatsoever to learn vanilla JavaScript, or anything related.\n\nBut my friends and I had to build a soft real-time, task-oriented robot for one of our classes.\n\nWe stumbled upon this new cool thing called Node.js (its docs back then). No fancy dependencies, easy child processes spawning, async and event-driven... and many online were saying it was the sh*t. We had absolutely no clue of what JavaScript or V8 were, but it still seemed like a good call for our project.\n\nPeers told me to find a decent library for my use cases, and pull off some copy/pasting art to get the socket communication job done. I could've done just that.\n\nBut I didn't. Although I didn't know it at the time, that was one of the best early career decisions I made.\n\nI started reading avidly instead. About asynchronous programming, the history of JavaScript, its pros and cons, everything. Because I wanted to master the underlying principles of the language powering my project. And it took quite a lot of time, coffee, beer, and dummy code to do so.\n\nIn between managing my teammates' impatience and creating a not-so-clean, functional robot codebase, I learned a whole dmn lot*.\n\nSo what's the point here? I took enough time to understand the core principles of JavaScript before using shortcuts provided by JS frameworks and libraries. Why is that important? Well, this is what this post is about: not just pretending.",

      "content": "Google on Thursday announced that Cloud Firestore, its cloud-native NoSQL database, is now out of beta and in General Availability. Google is also lowering prices for regional instances of Cloud Firestore and adding new locations to host Cloud Firestore data.\n\nBringing the fully-managed database into GA should help organizations that want to embrace serverless application development. Amazon Web Services introduced serverless computing with AWS Lambda and offers database services like Amazon Aurora Serverless and Amazon DynamoDB, where serverless is core to the design. Meanwhile, MongoDB has its Stitch serverless offering for its Atlas cloud service.\n\nCloud Firestore is integrated with both the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase, Google's mobile development platform. It makes it simple to store, sync, and query data for web, mobile, and IoT applications. While in beta, companies including The New York Times and the  scooter-sharing business Skip Scooters were using Cloud Firestore to build app experiences.\n\nNow that it's in GA, Cloud Firestore is included in GCP's official Service Level Agreements, guaranteeing 99.999% uptime for multi-region instances and 99.99% for regional instances. Moving out of beta also means that GCP's deprecation policy officially applies to Cloud Firestore and that Cloud Firestore is included among Google services that support HIPAA compliance.\n\nMost regional instances -- which are hosted in a single region and thus not as reliable as multi-region -- will be lower priced starting on March 3. In some locations, the price will be as low as 50 percent of multi-region instance prices.\n\nGoogle is also adding 10 new locations for hosting Cloud Firestore data, including a new multi-region location in Europe.\n\nGoogle is also adding a \"Usage\" tab in the Firebase console to help customers handle costs. It will show customers exactly how many reads, writes, and deletes their database has received over time.",
